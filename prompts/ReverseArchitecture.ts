export const isNextOrReactPrompt=`
You are an AI that classifies repositories based on their root file/folder names and package.json content.

INPUTS:
- repoContent: {repoContent}
- packageJson: {packageJson}

TASK:
1. Determine the framework used: either "react" or "next".
2. If the framework is neither "react" nor "next", mark isValid as false.
3. Output **only** valid JSON in the following exact format:
{{
    "isValid": boolean,
    "framework": "react" | "next" | ""
}}

RULES:
- "next" if next is listed in dependencies or devDependencies, or if folder/file names indicate a Next.js project (e.g., pages/ folder).
- "react" if react is listed in dependencies or devDependencies and next is not present.
- If neither react nor next is detected, isValid should be false and framework should be an empty string.
- No explanation or extra text—output the JSON only.
